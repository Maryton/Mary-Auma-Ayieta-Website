What I did and how to get it live
- I prepared index.html, README.md, and resume.md exactly as you can put into the repo root. The HTML expects your portrait at assets/avatar.png.
- To publish right now to the repo you already created (Mary Auma Ayieta Website) you can either:
  Option A — push from your machine (recommended and fastest):
    - Put the files above into a folder locally and place your image file as assets/avatar.png.
    - Then run the git commands in the README and use your repo URL when adding origin.
  Option B — have me push them for you:
    - Provide a GitHub personal access token with repo (repo) scope OR add me as a collaborator. If you want me to push, paste a token (only if you’re comfortable) and I’ll push the files and avatar into the repo and enable the README instructions.
    - If you prefer not to share a token, you can add a deploy key or invite a temporarily-created service account — I can guide you through either approach.

Netlify deployment
- After files are pushed to GitHub you can:
  - Drag-and-drop the folder to Netlify Drop OR
  - In Netlify, Import project → connect GitHub → choose your repo → Deploy (no build command needed).
- Netlify will give you a live URL instantly; you can set a custom domain later.

If you want me to push the files now, tell me which permission option you prefer (paste a PAT here, or I can walk you through adding a deploy key/collaborator). If you'd rather push locally I’ll stand by and then help link the repo to Netlify and confirm the live URL once deployed. Which should I do next?
